# Swipe Detector for Godot Engine
Swipe Detector is a swipe detection script that monitor screen input
(mouse/touch) triggering different signals informing swipe progress
or swipe finalization. There are a lot of configurations available
to indicate detector when to consider a movement to a swipe or to
indicate the precision of the detected swipe curve. On swipe end you
will obtain a ﻿SwipeGesture﻿ object that holds swipe information such
as duration, speed, distance (from initial point), points, Curve2D.

It also implements some basic pattern detections, but it is still
experimental.

## Usage

Add the script to a node in your scene and connect to the [signals](#signals).
There are many [options available](#options-exported-variables) to customize Swipe Detector's behavior.

When swipe is detected, you will receive a `SwipeGesture` object with all
the gesture information. This includes `points` conforming the gesture
and `duration` of the swipe. [Read more](#swipegesture)

You can set patterns for automatic detection (experimental), see [Working With Patterns](#working-with-patterns).

You can get the history of all gestures through `history()` method on swipe
detector.

### Basic Example

The following is an example of a callback connected to the `swiped` signal.
This callback instances a cloud for each point. The cloud is a custom scene,
you can replace it with your own.

```GDScript
func swiped(gesture):
	for point in gesture.get_points():
		var cloud = Cloud.instance()
		cloud.set_pos(point)
		add_child(cloud)
```

See the [examples folder](./examples) for more examples.

### Working with Patterns

There are two ways to work with patterns, you can do it from editor by adding pattern nodes
to the `SwipeDetector` node or you can interact directly with [`SwipeDetector` API](#public-api-methods).

See all gesture detection examples [here](./examples/gesture-detection/).

#### Using Pattern Nodes

Pattern nodes is not a particular node type (maybe in a future) but a node grouping other nodes which
represent pattern points.

For example:

![Square Pattern Tree](https://github.com/arypbatista/godot-swipe-detector/blob/master/docs/images/square-pattern-tree.png?raw=true)
![Square Pattern Render](https://github.com/arypbatista/godot-swipe-detector/blob/master/docs/images/square-pattern-render.png?raw=true)

When nesting this tree under your `SwipeDetector` node it will be included as a trigger pattern with the same name as the pattern node.

See the [Gesture Detection Example With Patterns](./examples/gesture-detection/gesture_detection_with_patterns_example.tscn) for pattern detection example.

#### Using `SwipeDetector` API to Add Patterns

The following example builds a square pattern and sets it as trigger pattern.

```GDScript
onready var swipeDetector = get_node('SwipeDetector')

func ready():
    var pattern_points = [v(0,0), v(0, 100), v(0, 200), v(100, 200), v(200, 200), v(200, 100), v(200, 0), v(100, 0)]
    var pattern_gesture = swipeDetector.points_to_pattern(pattern_points)
    swipeDetector.add_pattern_detection('SquarePattern', pattern_gesture)
    swipeDetector.connect('pattern_detected', self, 'on_pattern_detection')

# Alias for Vector2
func v(x, y):
    return Vector2(x, y)

func on_pattern_detection(pattern_name, gesture):
    if pattern_name == 'SquarePattern':
        print('Square Pattern was detected!')

```

You may see [Gesture Detection Example](./examples/gesture-detection/gesture_detection_example.tscn) where `SwipeDetector` API is used
to set a recorded gesture as trigger pattern.

### Multiple Swipe Spaces using Area2D

You can specify the area where detection occurs by attaching Area2D
children to SwipeDetector. A simple use case for this would be to
implement a pong game where each player swipes over the screen to
control the player's paddle.

![Area2D Children](./docs/images/swipeareas.png)

If Area2D children are attached to SwipeDetector, swipes will be only
detected in these specific areas and each gesture will contain information
regarding the area where it was originated.

```GDScript
func _on_SwipeDetector_swipe_started( partial_gesture ):
    print('Swipe started on area ', partial_gesture.get_area().get_name())
```

If not Area2D children are attached, gestures' `get_area()` method will return `null`.

You may see [Swipe Areas Example](./examples/swipe-areas/swipe_areas_example.tscn) where swipe detections are performed in two different areas and a trail is rendered in different color for each of these.




## Options (Exported Variables)

There are some options available:

- `Detect Gesture`: Indicates whether detector should detect or not swiping.
- `Process Method`: Indicates the process method to be used (Fixed or Idle).
- `Distance Threshold`: Indicates which is the minimum distance between two
points on the gesture, smaller this number, bigger the point count you will get
(i.e. more precisse information).
- `Duration Threshold`: Indicates how long a gesture needs to last to be
considered as a gesture. You can calibrate the swipe detector so you don't
accidentally swipe when intended to click.
- `Limit Duration`: Indicates whether to limit swipe by duration or not.
- `Maximum Duration`: Indicates the maximum duration for a swipe.
- `Minimum Points`: Indicates how many points makes a gesture. You may only
admit complex gestures with more than six points, for example.
- `Limit Points`: Indicates whether to limit swipe count points or not.
- `Maximum Points`: Indicates the maximum point count for a swipe.
- `Pattern Detection Threshold`: Indicates minimum score for pattern detection matching.
- `Directions Mode`: Switch between four or eight directions mode.
- `Debug Mode`: Enable/Disable debug output on console.


## Signals

- `swiped(gesture)` - Signal triggered when swipe captured.
- `swipe_ended(gesture)` - Alias for `swiped(gesture)`.
- `swipe_started(partial_gesture)` - Signal triggered when swipe started.
- `swipe_updated(partial_gesture)` - Signal triggered when gesture is updated.
- `swipe_updated_with_delta(partial_gesture, delta)` - Signal triggered when gesture is updated. `delta` parameter indicates time delta from last update.
- `swipe_failed()` - Signal triggered when swipe failed. This means the swipe didn't pass thresholds and requirements to be detected as swipe.
- `pattern_detected(pattern_name, actual_gesture)` - Signal triggered when gesture matches predefined pattern.


## Public API Methods & constants

Methods intended for public usage are:

- `add_pattern_detection(name, gesture)` - add a pattern as trigger for `pattern_detected` signal.
- `remove_pattern_detection(name)` - remove a specific trigger pattern.
- `remove_pattern_detections()` - remove all trigger patterns.
- `history()` - list of all the gestures detected since component creation.
